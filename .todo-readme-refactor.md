# README Refactor Todo List

## Phase 1: Structure & Links Verification ✅
- [x] Verify all hyperlinks in main README point to correct sub-READMEs
- [x] Ensure each sub-README is properly linked in Documentation Index
- [x] Add brief summaries for each documentation section in main README

## Phase 2: Content Enhancement ✅
- [x] Rewrite "What is axe?" section with better tone (aloof, practical, human)
- [x] Expand "Why axe exists" with stronger positioning against vibe coders
- [x] Add comprehensive axe-dig explanation (inspired by TLDR doc but original tone)
- [x] Include axe-dig 5-layer architecture explanation with practical examples
- [x] Add token savings examples and real-world performance metrics
- [x] Explain daemon architecture and why it's 300x faster

## Phase 3: Bodega Models & Configuration ✅
- [x] Review sample_config.toml for Bodega provider examples
- [x] Add Bodega provider configuration examples in main README
- [x] Ensure all SRSWTI/Bodega models are properly showcased
- [x] Link to configuration documentation

## Phase 4: Upcoming Features & Vision ✅
- [x] Expand debugging features section with concrete examples
- [x] Add visualization capabilities (call graphs, dependency graphs, AST viz)
- [x] Emphasize production engineering focus vs vibe coding
- [x] Add section on codebase visualization features

## Phase 5: Tone & Polish ✅
- [x] Review entire main README for tone consistency (aloof, cool, professional)
- [x] Ensure technical accuracy while maintaining accessibility
- [x] Add practical examples throughout
- [x] Remove any overly marketing-heavy language
- [x] Ensure "show, don't tell" approach

## Phase 6: Final Review ✅
- [x] Verify all internal links work
- [x] Check that sub-READMEs are referenced appropriately
- [x] Ensure main README is concise but comprehensive
- [x] Validate that axe-dig is properly positioned as the secret weapon

## Summary

✅ **All phases complete!**

### Key improvements made:

1. **axe-dig Deep Dive**: Added comprehensive explanation of 5-layer architecture with real debugging example showing 95% token savings
2. **Semantic Search**: Explained how behavioral search works with embeddings and call graph analysis
3. **Daemon Architecture**: Detailed 300x speedup explanation with incremental updates
4. **Bodega Integration**: Full configuration examples with all model series (Raptor, Flagship, Axe-Turbo, Specialized)
5. **Upcoming Features**: Expanded with execution tracing, performance debugging, and visual debugging sections
6. **Tone**: Professional, aloof, practical - "not for vibe coders" positioning throughout
7. **Documentation Index**: Clear summaries for each sub-README with emoji icons
8. **Visual Debugging Preview**: Added call graphs, dependency graphs, AST visualizations coming soon
9. **Production Focus**: Emphasized real engineering vs weekend projects throughout

The README now properly showcases axe-dig as the secret weapon while maintaining an accessible, human tone that's both technical and engaging.
